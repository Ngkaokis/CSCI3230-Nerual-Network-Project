# Drug-Molecular-Toxicity-Prediction---Neural-Network-Project
Given a dataset of drug molecules with their SMILES expressions and the binary labels indicating whether one drug molecule is toxic or not. A Deep Neural Network is developed to learn the pattern and predict the toxicity of a new list of molecules based on learned knowledge using TensorFlow package.
